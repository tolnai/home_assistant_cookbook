# Home Assistant Cookbook

These are some random useful things (guides, examples, config, code, etc.) that I'm happy to share in the area of Home Assistant, so that it may be useful to others.

- ["Időkép" weather integration](https://github.com/tolnai/home_assistant_idokep_scraper/): Use Hungarian "Időkép" weather service as weather data source (has a separate repository)
- [Messenger integration](messenger-integration): Sending notifications to Facebook Messenger.

(List is expected to grow in the future...)
